This directory contains a series of projects from The Odin Project Curriculum.

** The Caesar Cipher ** [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/caesar-cipher] 

For this project I had to build a program that takes 2 inputs from the user, a string and a shifter and display the encoded solution as an output.

** Substrings ** [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/sub-strings]

For this project I built a program that takes a phrase from the user. I then compare this phrase the user gave me with words from my dictionary(array) and notated the amount of times a word from my dictionary appears inside the phrase given. I display the results in a hash.

** Stock Picker ** [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/stock-picker?ref=lnav]

For this project I built a program that takes an array of prices (one for each day) and find the best day to buy and best day to sell based on overall profit. 

** Bubble Sort ** [https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/bubble-sort?ref=lnav]

For this project I built a program that sorts through an array in bubble sort fashion. It compares the first element of the array to the next element, and if the next id greater, it switches them. It does this until it sorts an array from least to greatest.
